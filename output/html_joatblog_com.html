          <p class="post">This site is getting redone. I am also currently working on a few other sites at the moment. Goal is end of October to have everything up and running. I may or may not post. I struggled on whether I should delete everything or not. I still don't know. It is in my nature to tear everything dowwn and restart. I don't think that is a good choice.</p>

</body></html><!-- entry template: Use this to add new posts to the current page. Just copy-pasta this shit. Rework timestamp to current time, add image to src="", type a motherfuckin caption for that shit, and maybe an alt, and put your thoughts between the <p>s. If no image, you can delete figure or not, with nothing in it, it shouldn't affect anything.
